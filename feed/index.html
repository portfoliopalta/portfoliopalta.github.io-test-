				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title">It&#8217;s absolutely essential in today&#8217;s competitive environment that your business has a website, no matter how big or small it is.</p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title">However, to most people creating a website can be a daunting task. There&#8217;s so much information out there that it&#8217;s hard to know where to begin. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve put together a quick overview of the steps you can take to create a professional looking website for your business.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">The first step in building a website is to choose which platform you&#8217;re going to build your website with. The days of hard-coding a website from scratch are long gone, and we are now living in the era of &#8216;website platforms&#8217;, otherwise known as content management systems (CMS).</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">You might be familiar with some of these platforms, such as WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Drupal or Joomlal. These platforms make building websites easy for most people to get started without much website development experience.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">However, the downside of using a simplistic website builder is that your level of control over the flexibility of the design is restricted, which means that you won&#8217;t easily be able to make it bespoke to your specific needs. For example, if you wanted a certain element to be in one particular portion of the screen, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to easily move it.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">Therefore, despite how intuitive some of the attractive builders might look, it often results in users left feeling frustrated over the lack of flexibility in the website&#8217;s design.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">Once you know which website platform you&#8217;d like to choose, there are two things that you need to get your website online. These are a domain name (a web address like yoursitename.com) and website hosting (a service that connects your site to the internet).</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">As mentioned, the WordPress platform itself is free, but hosting and name domain name are not. However, domains usually cost around £10/year, and standard website hosting is roughly £5/month.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">As a guideline, it&#8217;s important that your website loads in under 2 seconds otherwise you&#8217;ll risk losing website traffic. Therefore, it&#8217;s essential that you find a good quality website host with servers located near to your end consumers to minimise load times.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">Good quality hosts that I&#8217;ve personally used are 1&amp;1 Ionos (based all around the UK), and 34SP (based in Manchester). Both of these companies have excellent load speeds and customer support.</span></p></div>

As suggested so far, I recommend using WordPress to build your website as it gives you a lot more flexibility, functionality and scope for expansion as your business grows.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">This is the fun part, but it&#8217;s but also one of the most critical steps.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">To give you an overview of the design process, I&#8217;ve laid out a 6-step process flow chart for what I usually do when creating a new website. </span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">The important takeaway from this is to take the time to draw out some rough designs, write down your brand colours and decide on the main function of each page. The more effort you can put into the planning stage, the easier it will be when it comes to making it.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span class="JsGRdQ">Even though your website is now live, you&#8217;ll still need to add your website to Google so that it will appear in the search page results. If you don&#8217;t do this step, Google won&#8217;t be able to find your website.</span></p>
<p><span class="JsGRdQ">When Google receives a search query from a user (such as &#8216;treats for dogs&#8217;), Google&#8217;s algorithm will instantly evaluate the most appropriate websites to show the user based on the factors below.<span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>How To Optimise For Important Ranking Factors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backlinks: </strong><span class="JsGRdQ">A backlink is created when one website links to another. When a website receives multiple backlinks from &#8216;high authority websites&#8217;, Google sees this as a vote of confidence in the site&#8217;s ability and will rank it higher for certain terms.</span></li>
<li><strong>Speed: </strong><span class="JsGRdQ">A slow-loading website can result in a lower quality experience for the user. As Google doesn&#8217;t want this, it might hinder the ranking performance. To improve this, optimise your images and use a high quality hosting company.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mobile Responsiveness: </strong><span class="JsGRdQ">A responsive website is one that adapts to smaller screen sizes on mobile. These days, most themes available automatically have responsiveness built into them, but it&#8217;s always important to ensure your site has the ability to change its appearance based on the screen it&#8217;s being viewed on.</span></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong><span class="JsGRdQ">A keyword is a word (or phrase) that a user would enter as a search query into Google. You will need to take the terms that you want your website to rank for and place them throughout your webpage. However, don&#8217;t be overly excessive as you&#8217;ll risk a penalty.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></li>
<li><strong>Website Structure: </strong><span class="JsGRdQ">The structure of your website refers to how the different pages interlink throughout the site. A healthy structure will feature multiple links which are relevant to the user whilst making navigation easy. Plus, it helps search engines to understand your website better.</span></li>

Establishing an emotional connection with your customers is the best way to retain them build loyalty over a long period of time.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">In order to do this, it&#8217;s important to expand your brand from just on your website, and out onto physical items such as business cards, staff uniform, vehicle decals and sales brochures (both print and eBook).</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">By doing this, you&#8217;ll be able to bring your brand to life and form consistency on both the digital and physical front.</span></p>

<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">One of the best cost-effective tools for reaching your customers is social media. Long gone are the days of spending loads of money on expensive television adverts in the hope it might reach some of your target customers. </span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">Instead, social media platforms allow you to put your brand in front of your exact target audience for only a fraction of the cost of other methods.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-title"><span class="JsGRdQ">These platforms will show your adverts to prospects based on location, demographic and interests etc. with fantastic returns on investment.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><strong>Top Tips &amp; Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="JsGRdQ">Know Your Audience: </span></strong><span class="JsGRdQ">It&#8217;s worth taking to time to understand what solutions your target market would want. To visual it, create a persona of your typical end consumer and outline what their objectives might be.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></li>
<li><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"><strong><span class="JsGRdQ">Test, Measure and Optimise: </span></strong><span class="JsGRdQ">Remember to test a wide range of adverts with varying types of content and imagery. After this, if you see that one of your posts is converting better than others or getting higher engagement, keep running it and drop the worst performing ones.</span> </span></li>
<li><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"><strong><span class="JsGRdQ">Be Patient: </span></strong><span class="JsGRdQ">Despite the fact that the use of social media adverts is the fastest way to get your brand recognised, it might take 3-4 cycles of adverts before you begin to understand what type of adverts appeal most to your target market.</span> </span></li>

However, I&#8217;d suggest following these important points to ensure that your website avoids any technical issues.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="JsGRdQ"><strong>Keep Plugins Up To Date:</strong> </span><span class="JsGRdQ">With WordPress, you can enable &#8216;auto-updates by going to Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins and then toggling them on.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="JsGRdQ">Test Forms and Checkouts: </span></strong><span class="JsGRdQ">Occasionally, an update in the website&#8217;s code can cause functionality issues. If this happened then it would prevent customers from completing the checkout process or submitting an enquiry form, which would impact your business&#8217;s bottom line.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="JsGRdQ">Back-Up Your Website:</span></strong><span class="JsGRdQ"> Install a plugin from WordPress to store a backup of your website which you can use if you accidentally break it whilst editing or making changes to it.</span><span class="JsGRdQ white-space-prewrap"> </span></li>
</ul>

					<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_6">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_8  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays every article you read on digital marketing tends to circulate around the explosion in demand for video content and how it will continue to rise into the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst that is evidently true as statistics show that </span><a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/social-media-marketing-2/the-importance-of-video-content-on-social-media/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video content on social media generates up to 1200% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">more shares than texts and images combined. These gurus are often overlooking a crucial but forgotten feature in the social media world: audio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this seems to be making a recent resurgence in demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, this begs the question&#8230;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Is Audio Important To Your Social Media Strategy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is because the way we consume content has changed. What I mean by this is that people are more often opting to consume content passively whilst doing something active such as walking through the park, performing household chores, going shopping or travelling in a vehicle. This means that many people aren’t even watching the video. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This growth in passive audio consumption can be evidenced by the rapid expansion in popularity of podcasts over the last few years, as reports show that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/after-a-breakout-year-looking-ahead-to-the-future-of-podcasting/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACuR5ln1L1St1SN92B94Ap-FjZq1CFPcQE89TI2s3-jF8elQyt9Bo_wZBqJnlNGL-jT7Ilg-51XfRlKlCAQxxEZmzRHDOoE-jaf4d4QLvm0dWhOpXNHNwCUARRhAcO1e9L7pn4UZS5-kp_LIclbjQYIJfaUlmi6g32FWMwW44xzf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">32% of US residents listen </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to a podcast monthly (up 26% from the previous year). Demonsttrationg the importance of audio in your social media strategy. </span></p>
<p><b>A few reasons for this growth in audio demand include:</b></p>
<p><b>Increased Intimacy:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Audio is a more intimate type of content than regular video content. This is because audio content is usually consumed through the use of headphones which forms a deeper connection to the creator than a video could. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theory is that this would increase the listener’s trust and preference with the creator, which is why people are more likely to spread ‘positive messages’ about the podcast with their friends than they would do so with videos.</span></p>
<p><b>Greater Attention Span: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio content has the ability to capture a person’s attention span for much longer than a regular video would. For example, the average attention span for video content is about 8 seconds, whilst this average increases to over 30 minutes for podcasts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, this provides a fantastic opportunity for a company looking to put across their message without losing their consumer’s attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio isn’t just limited to podcasting formats either as more social networks are introducing new audio features onto their platforms. For example, Facebook will allow users to share a voice message to their stories if they don’t want to turn the camera on, and Instagram has given their users the ability to share their favourite songs to their story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This shorter form of audio content isn’t just restricted to everyday users, it’s something that your business should be taking advantage of as it provides a way to reach people that prefer this sort </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">of content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading that, you might be thinking&#8230;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Does This Mean For Your Business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like a lot of things, the effectiveness and relevance of audio to your business’s social media strategy depends on the market you’re in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you’re primarily B2C and Facebook is your go to platform, then it’s worth noting that </span><a href="https://digiday.com/media/silent-world-facebook-video/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">85% of Facebook videos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are watched with the sound off. Whereas </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-96-percent-users-watch-video-sound-on-2016-10?r=US&amp;IR=T"><span style="font-weight: 400;">96% of YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> viewers will watch with the sound on. Therefore, you’d need to ensure that any content you create is repurposed with that specific platform’s usage tendencies in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that you need to include subtitles, annotations and enhanced visuals for platforms that often use silent videos, but ensure to spend the time stripping the audio off to redistribute it on platforms that take advantage of audio such as Spotify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, it&#8217;s a case of trial and error to eventually see what your audience (and your eventual clients) prefer. So it’s worth taking the time to incorporate at least some form of audio into your social media strategy, whether that’s a podcast or in long-form YouTube content. </span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a practical solution to displaying a large volume of content on a website can be a tricky one. This issue has become particularly pressing recently with the sheer amount of data and online content that we have available everyday as studies show that there are over</span><a href="https://growthbadger.com/blog-stats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2 billion blog posts every year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is 4,000 posts every minute. That’s a lot of content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, don’t fear, as there are a few solutions available to help us organise some of this &#8211; one of them being pagination.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Pagination In SEO?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In web design, pagination is the process of splitting up content into multiple pages in order to make a large piece of content more easily digestible to the end user. These pieces of content are tied together using a button link for ‘next’ and ‘previous’ to allow the user to navigate through the content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of this can be seen in the way google displays their pages in the search results, as the user would be required to scroll to the bottom of the page and manually click the ‘next’ and ‘previous’ button to see more results.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the web, you might have seen this being used in the following two cases:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large Articles &#8211; Used to separate out sections of a large article into multiple pages. This is commonly used on blogging websites.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Pages &#8211; Used to allow the user to only be able to view a certain number (10 &#8211; 20) of items at once. This is often seen on ecommerce stores product pages.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are The Advantages Of Pagination In SEO?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With pagination, web designers are able to attain a few advantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Provides Structure To Long-Form Content:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There isn’t much worse than the overwhelming feeling you get before you tackle a long and daunting article online. This issue is remedied by pagination as the user would be able to digest the content in bit-sized pieces, making it easy for them to digest and process the article. In theory, this should boost engagement rates (shares and comments), helping it to climb the search rankings as Google sees more value in it.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Drives Users To The Footer: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the pagination feature, the user is actively searching for the ‘next’ and ‘previous’ buttons which are located near the footer. This is important as web designers tend to place their call to actions, additional resources and contact information near the footer and so users are more likely to stop scrolling near this area to find the buttons, which therefore increases the likelihood that they’ll engage with the call to actions in the footer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are The Disadvantages Of Pagination In SEO?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it’s worth noting that pagination does come with a few disadvantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Link Dilution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google requires a page to contain a substantial amount of content in order for it to index and rank well. However, with pagination, the pages are spread out across multiple pages which could leave them quite ‘thin’ in content and therefore, not rank very well. This is often the case with slideshows where each page contains only one image which might prevent it from ranking highly.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Slow Cumulative Loading Times:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With pagination, the user will be required to load each page individually every time they want to see the next section of content, which could take 1-2 seconds each to load. Over time, this could add up to a total of 8 &#8211; 12 seconds of loading time by the time they’ve got to the final page, incrementally frustrating the user. This can be seen in the image below as loading successive pages would accumulate to more load time overall when compared to just loading one page.</span></li>
</ul></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_divider_10 et_pb_space et_pb_divider_hidden"><div class="et_pb_divider_internal"></div></div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_7">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://portfoliopalta.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pagination-Page-Load-Time-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Pagination SEO - Page Load Time" title="Pagination - Page Load Time (1)" srcset="https://portfoliopalta.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pagination-Page-Load-Time-1-980x551.jpg 980w, https://portfoliopalta.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pagination-Page-Load-Time-1-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" class="wp-image-1849" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_divider_11 et_pb_space et_pb_divider_hidden"><div class="et_pb_divider_internal"></div></div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_25  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">To solve this, the web designer could ask Google to index only the ‘view all’ page to ensure the user loads all of the pieces of content first when entering the site to reduce the overall loading time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does Pagination Compare To Infinite Scroll In SEO?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on these advantages and disadvantages, it’s worth considering a few other options before installing pagination onto your site. One of the more popular options is ‘infinite scroll’, where the user would be able to scroll down a single webpage and once they reach the bottom of the page, the new content loads automatically &#8211; similar to how the news feed works on social media platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scrolling feature is more intuitive for users on mobile devices, and given that </span><a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/statistics/mobile-internet-traffic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost 50% of all internet traffic is mobile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this can be quite useful. Infinite scroll might provide a better user experience and boost engagement, but it has serious implications for SEO as Google crawlers will only be able to take a snapshot of what’s initially loaded on the page and will struggle to see what lies beyond the bottom of the bottom of the page. This means that a large majority of your content on your article or product page might not get indexed by Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where pagination shines, as the more rigid structure and hierarchy helps Google to understand the page better, which often leads to increased search ranking positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should You Use Pagination On Your Website?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice to use pagination on your website is dependent on what sort of website it is and what experience you’re trying to make your users have. For example, pagination is better suited for eCommerce stores as it provides a structure for displaying the vast amount of content and a wide range of products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if your site is based more around a ‘gallery’ format such as a wedding photographer, then infinite scroll would be more appropriate as it allows users to wander through your images without too much interruption.</span></p>
<p>You might also find that a CMF (Content Management Framework), such as <a href="https://www.it-consultis.com/blog/developing-drupal-website-china">Drupal,</a> useful in the pagination of your content. This is because the CMF&#8217;s configurations allow your content to be split up in a structured, yet personalised way, therefore improving the Google SEO rankings for your webpages.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, it depends on the objectives for your website, but it&#8217;s worth noting that pagination will be better optimised for Google search rankings. <span>If you’re looking to boost your Google search engine rankings, find out more about our <a href="https://portfoliopalta.github.io//seo-services-in-nottingham/">SEO services </a></span><span>or get in touch today.

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s fair to say that Google loves mobile responsive websites. In fact, Google saw mobile usage account for over </span><a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/#:~:text=However%2C%20June%202019%20saw%20mobile,the%20top%20option%20for%20searchers."><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% of searches in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This, in combination with </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-first-indexing#:~:text=Mobile%2Dfirst%20indexing%20means%20Google,page%20to%20a%20user's%20query."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of using mobile-first indexing indicates a shift in user preference towards mobile searches over desktop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, website owners often jump at anything that can give them an advantage in the mobile search rankings &#8211; which an AMP plugin is said to give them. But first, it’s worth understanding exactly what an AMP is before using it on your website.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is An AMP Plugin?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages. To everyday web users, it is a plugin that can be installed onto your WordPress website with the aim of making the web content load faster when viewed on a mobile device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, the plugin will strip back any excess design code (CSS and Javascript) to load a more basic version of the webpage. The absence of this code allows visitors to load the webpage almost instantly on their mobile devices, which is ideal for mobile users as their search intent often carries a shorter time period than desktop users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows for smooth-loading which prioritises the user experience above all else. A lot of us might be already using an AMP without even knowing it, as a similar version can be seen on the articles within Apple News or Facebook Instant Articles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can tell when a website has AMP plugin installed on their website by the lightning bolt symbol next to the link. This is shown in the image below as 3 out of the 4 links have a symbol next to them to indicate that they have got AMP installed.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are The Benefits Of An AMP plugin?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two main benefits to installing AMP on your website:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Faster Loading Times:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Using an AMP plugin will give your website a faster loading time, which therefore provides visitors with a better user experience. The theory is that this could have a knock on effect of lower bounce rates, more time spent on site and higher conversions &#8211; all because users are happier.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Better SEO:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having AMP installed on your website hasn&#8217;t been confirmed by Google as being a factor in the search rankings, but fast loading times have been &#8211; which is exactly what AMP provides. So the speed benefit will factor into Google’s determination of ranking position.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are The Drawbacks Of An AMP plugin?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these advantages, AMP also comes with a few drawbacks that need to be considered:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Restrictive Design: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to decrease the load time, the website would have to be stripped back of any unique styles and brand design. Therefore, it becomes a trade-off between the two &#8211; speed or appearance. This being said, there are many </span><a href="https://ampforwp.com/tutorials/article/how-to-enable-amp-on-divi-one-click-solution/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available to support the website’s original design whilst using an AMP, but these are typically expensive.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Basic Analytics:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In today’s world, data is everything. However, AMP only provides the website’s owner with very basic analytical data such as visitor numbers and engagement which leaves much to be desired in the more advanced analytical departments.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is My Personal Experience With AMP Plugins? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that much like many things in life, there’s a time and place for everything. What I mean by this is that certain websites would benefit from this more than others. For example, An AMP would be more beneficial for a breaking News website, as load time is more important to users and brand image is less essential in these particular situations. </span></p>
<p>Therefore, it’s a trade-off. Whilst an AMP plugin can dramatically reduce load times and boost user experience, I don&#8217;t feel like it outweighs the negative impact from the loss in webpage’s unique design. In this competitive online market, brand identity is key to standing out which could be sacrificed to make way for faster load times, which shouldn&#8217;t be the primary objective of any website.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst the impact of the design restrictions will vary for different website owners depending on their website builder, it nonetheless still degrades the website’s appearance as it can often make it look very basic and ‘bareboned’. </span></p>
<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t think it’s necessary for everyone to have an AMP on their website as there are plenty of other ways to attain faster loading times on mobile, such as selecting better web hosting, optimising code, using appropriately sized images and many more.</p>
