				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays every article you read on digital marketing tends to circulate around the explosion in demand for video content and how it will continue to rise into the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst that is evidently true as statistics show that </span><a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/social-media-marketing-2/the-importance-of-video-content-on-social-media/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video content on social media generates up to 1200% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">more shares than texts and images combined. These gurus are often overlooking a crucial but forgotten feature in the social media world: audio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this seems to be making a recent resurgence in demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, this begs the question&#8230;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Is Audio Important To Your Social Media Strategy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is because the way we consume content has changed. What I mean by this is that people are more often opting to consume content passively whilst doing something active such as walking through the park, performing household chores, going shopping or travelling in a vehicle. This means that many people aren’t even watching the video. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This growth in passive audio consumption can be evidenced by the rapid expansion in popularity of podcasts over the last few years, as reports show that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/after-a-breakout-year-looking-ahead-to-the-future-of-podcasting/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACuR5ln1L1St1SN92B94Ap-FjZq1CFPcQE89TI2s3-jF8elQyt9Bo_wZBqJnlNGL-jT7Ilg-51XfRlKlCAQxxEZmzRHDOoE-jaf4d4QLvm0dWhOpXNHNwCUARRhAcO1e9L7pn4UZS5-kp_LIclbjQYIJfaUlmi6g32FWMwW44xzf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">32% of US residents listen </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to a podcast monthly (up 26% from the previous year). Demonsttrationg the importance of audio in your social media strategy. </span></p>
<p><b>A few reasons for this growth in audio demand include:</b></p>
<p><b>Increased Intimacy:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Audio is a more intimate type of content than regular video content. This is because audio content is usually consumed through the use of headphones which forms a deeper connection to the creator than a video could. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theory is that this would increase the listener’s trust and preference with the creator, which is why people are more likely to spread ‘positive messages’ about the podcast with their friends than they would do so with videos.</span></p>
<p><b>Greater Attention Span: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio content has the ability to capture a person’s attention span for much longer than a regular video would. For example, the average attention span for video content is about 8 seconds, whilst this average increases to over 30 minutes for podcasts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, this provides a fantastic opportunity for a company looking to put across their message without losing their consumer’s attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio isn’t just limited to podcasting formats either as more social networks are introducing new audio features onto their platforms. For example, Facebook will allow users to share a voice message to their stories if they don’t want to turn the camera on, and Instagram has given their users the ability to share their favourite songs to their story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This shorter form of audio content isn’t just restricted to everyday users, it’s something that your business should be taking advantage of as it provides a way to reach people that prefer this sort </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">of content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading that, you might be thinking&#8230;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Does This Mean For Your Business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like a lot of things, the effectiveness and relevance of audio to your business’s social media strategy depends on the market you’re in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you’re primarily B2C and Facebook is your go to platform, then it’s worth noting that </span><a href="https://digiday.com/media/silent-world-facebook-video/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">85% of Facebook videos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are watched with the sound off. Whereas </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-96-percent-users-watch-video-sound-on-2016-10?r=US&amp;IR=T"><span style="font-weight: 400;">96% of YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> viewers will watch with the sound on. Therefore, you’d need to ensure that any content you create is repurposed with that specific platform’s usage tendencies in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that you need to include subtitles, annotations and enhanced visuals for platforms that often use silent videos, but ensure to spend the time stripping the audio off to redistribute it on platforms that take advantage of audio such as Spotify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, it&#8217;s a case of trial and error to eventually see what your audience (and your eventual clients) prefer. So it’s worth taking the time to incorporate at least some form of audio into your social media strategy, whether that’s a podcast or in long-form YouTube content. </span></p>
